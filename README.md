# Automata and Grammar Project

This repository contains the work carried out by the group formed by **Eliel Mato** and **Facundo Merino** for the **Automata and Grammar** course. The project involves using Python to read CSV files, extract information, and create classes to represent automata and grammars.

## Project Description

This project aims to explore the concepts of automata and grammars by using Python. We implemented classes that handle the parsing and processing of information extracted from CSV files. The project demonstrates how automata can be represented programmatically and how grammars are applied to generate strings or parse inputs.

### Features:
- **CSV Parsing**: Read data from CSV files to create automata or grammars.
- **Automata Classes**: Define classes that represent different types of automata (e.g., DFA, NFA).
- **Grammar Classes**: Define classes that represent various types of grammars (e.g., Context-Free Grammar).
- **Automaton Simulation**: Simulate the execution of automata with given inputs.
